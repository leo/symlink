# What this does

Ever needed an easy way to create symbolic links for a directory on OS X? Then just give this a spin. It's a extremely simple workflow-file that adds a item to the right-click-menu on directories called "Create Symlink". As soon as you click it, a symbolic link will be created right next to the orginal one.

# How it works

1. Download the repository, unzip it and rename the created folder to "symlink.workflow"
2. Drag the file into ```~/Library/Services```
3. Bang, you're ready! :collision:

# Use it

Just open the Finder and navigate to the parent-directory of a folder that you'd like to create a Symlink of. Then right-click on it and select "Create Symlink" under "Services" (at the bottom of the menu).
